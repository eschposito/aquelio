# aquelio
This is a new open source hardware and software maker project named Aquelio. It was presented
at the Maker Faire Rome 2017. Full documentation for hardware and software will soon be
published in this repository.
Aquelio uses 4 photovoltaic panels to heat the water in an electric water heater.
It is based on:
- ST's NUCLEOF303RE board, programmed with ARM mbed for the low level control and
power conversion parts;
- Raspberry Pi 3 B for the web enabled user interface, programmed in the Go language.
For now the uploaded files are only work in progress, unfinished, for the user interface part.
